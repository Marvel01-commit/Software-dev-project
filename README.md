Git Workflow

To keep the project organized, do not work directly on main or
develop.

The workflow is:

main
  │
  └── develop
       │
       ├── feat/authentication
       ├── feat/repositories
       ├── feat/commits
       ├── feat/issues
       ├── feat/comments
       ├── feat/collaborators
       ├── feat/frontend-dashboard
       └── feat/frontend-ui

Each member should work on their own feature branch.

# Getting Started
Clone the repository:
  git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>

Enter the project:
  cd mini-github

Switch to the develop branch:
  git checkout develop

Get the latest changes:
  git pull origin develop

# Create Your Feature Branch
Create a branch for the feature you are working on.
Example:
  git checkout -b feat/login
Other examples:
  git checkout -b feat/register
  git checkout -b feat/repositories
  git checkout -b feat/commits
  git checkout -b feat/issues
  git checkout -b feat/comments
  git checkout -b feat/collaborators
  git checkout -b feat/dashboard

Use a clear branch name that describes your task.

# Working on Your Feature
Work only on the feature assigned to you.
For example:
  * Authentication → feat/authentication
  * Repository CRUD → feat/repositories
  * Issues → feat/issues
  * Dashboard → feat/dashboard

Do not unnecessarily modify another teammate’s feature.
If you believe another teammate’s code needs to be changed or refactored,
inform the team in the WhatsApp group before making major changes.

# Commit Messages
After implementing your feature:
  .git add

Commit your changes using a clear commit message:
  git commit -m "feat: implement login"
For new features, use the feat: prefix.

Examples:
  git commit -m "feat: implement user registration"
  git commit -m "feat: add repository creation"
  git commit -m "feat: add issue creation"
  git commit -m "feat: add repository dashboard"

# Push Your Feature Branch
Push your feature branch to GitHub:
  git push -u origin feat/login
Replace feat/login with your own branch name.

# Pull Request
After pushing your feature branch:
  1. Go to GitHub.
  2. Open a Pull Request.
  3. The Pull Request should be:

feature branch → develop
Example:
  feat/login → develop

Do not create the Pull Request directly into main.
The team should review the Pull Request before merging it into develop.

# Important Git Rules
  1. Do not work directly on main.
  2. Do not work directly on develop.

Always create a feature branch.
  3. Pull the latest develop before starting new work.
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop

Then create your feature branch.
  4. Test your code before pushing.
Make sure your feature works before creating a Pull Request.

# Running the Backend
Inside the backend folder:
  npm run dev
Use Postman to test the backend APIs during development.

# Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend:
  PORT=5000
  MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection
  JWT_SECRET=your_secret

# Do not commit the .env file to GitHub.
Make sure .gitignore contains:
  node_modules/
  .env

# Team Communication
This README will be updated as the project progresses.

For now, use the WhatsApp group to communicate:
  * Task assignments
  * Feature progress
  * Problems or bugs
  * Required changes
  * Refactoring discussions
  * Pull Request reviews

If you need to modify or refactor another teammate’s code, inform the team
before making major changes.
